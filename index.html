<!-- intro paragraph text-->
<p id="introparagraph">
  I am a full-time Senior at The University of Georgia graduating Summmer 2019. For the first one and a half years of college
  I jumped around from two different science majors: Biology and Excercise Science. But those two majors never
  clicked for me. But in the Spring of 2017, <strong>I began to pursue a B.S. in Computer Science and finally
  felt like I found something that I loved.</strong> Since then, I have developed a passion for Software Engineering! <br><br>
  I am currently working at <strong>Cox Enterprises</strong> (Cox Automotive Branch) as a software engineer
  working on the Manheim.com website during the Summer of '18  to gain more
  knowledge in programming!</br></br> Aside from programming and school work, I lead worship
  at a church called First Baptist Church of Woodstock, enjoy playing piano and guitar, and riding horses.

<p id="smallsatlab">
  Recently, I joined the University of Georgia's <strong>Small Satellite Research Lab </strong>(SSRL)as a Software Engineer to
  help develop the ground station user interface.
  The UGA Small Satellite Research Laboratory was founded in 2016 with the goal of launching a student built spacecraft
  - a CubeSat - into low earth orbit. Our mission is to place UGA among the top spacefaring universities
  in the world and to give UGA a permanent presence in outer space.

  <br></br>
  <strong>The Mapping and Ocean Color Imager</strong> (MOCI) cube sat is funded by the <strong>Air Force Research Laboratory’s
  </strong>(AFRL) <strong>ninth iteration of the University Nanosatellite Program </strong>(UNP). The MOCI mission will
  acquire imagery of the Earth’s surface from LEO and perform real time Structure from Motion (SfM)
  at a landscape scale. The MOCI mission will also identify and map coastal phenomena such as
  sediment plumes and algal blooms while training students in STEM related fields.
  <br></br>

  <strong>The SPectral Ocean Color</strong> (SPOC) satellite mission, is funded through <strong>NASA’s second iteration of the Undergraduate
  Student Instrument Project (USIP)</strong>. The SPOC shall acquire moderate resolution imagery across a wide range of spectral
  bands to monitor coastal ecosystems and ocean color. It will acquire image data between 400 and 850 nm to monitor 1)
  coastal wetlands status, 2) estuarine water quality including wetland biophysical characteristics and phytoplankton dynamics,
  and 3) near-coastal ocean productivity. SPOC shall use hyperspectral remote sensing techniques to quantify vegetation health,
  primary productivity, ocean productivity, suspended sediments, and organic matter in coastal regions.

Currently, I am appart of UGA's <strong>Association for Computing Machinery</strong> (ACM) chapter. In addition to this, I also
am a part of their <strong>mentorship program.</strong> Their mentorship program allows them to assign upper classmen in the same
Computer Science major to lower classmen who are just getting started in their experience. I am currently a mentor to a lower classman
where I am responsible for answering any career related questions, giving help with homework & projects, and meeting about
once a month to catch up and talk about life.

     <p>

      In my final project of my systems programming class, I was tasked to implement a clone of a Unix Shell. Any command that can
      be found in envp of the c++ unistd library was implemented in my program. I also implemented my own requirements such as
      I/O redirection (which I did using dup and dup2), changing environmental variables, and prompts for the pwd. I gained experience in
      learning how to research functions and libraries that could be useful for my program, tokenizing, stress and time management (It was supposed to be
      a paired programming assignment but my partner was MIA), and systems programming.

     <p>

       Over the courseo of 2 Projects, I worked on writing my own programs for major system calls. This was done using low level
       programming with file descriptors and direct command line input. It included true/false, env, forkpid, cat, wc,
       newer, size, and dirlist. Here, I gained experience in systems programming, along with a good bit of paired programming with
       my parnter. Please click on the links below to view the code.

     <p>

       In this project, I implemented a program that would simulate an electornic Matrix. This includes transform,
       add, subtract, multiply, divide, expand, etc... This handles single scalars as well as adding other Matricies
       together. For the second part of my project, I implemented operator overloads to my customization. This included
       overloading +, -, /, * and more. I utilized classes, header files, the friend function, operator overload, and vigorous
       testing and handling in this project.

      <p>
      In this project, I implemented a single GUI application in Java using JavaFX 8 that
      provides an arcade with two playable games: Reversi and Breakout. Here, I gained experience in the ability to:
      plan, design, implement, test, debug, and deploy a complete object-oriented
      software solution in Linux/Unix environment. I utilitze paired programming, inheritance and polymorphism,
      devloped a GUI for a software programming project, implement exception-handling, and was able
      to understand and apply langauge basics using an OOP language.

      <p>
        In this project, I implemented a GUI application in Java using JavaFX 8 that displays a
        gallery of images based on the results of a search query to the iTunes search API. I learned how to
        display images, and handle threads, JSON, and parse through the iTunes Search API.
        Here, I gained more knowledge in the ability to:
        plan, design, implement, test, debug, and deploy a complete object-oriented
        software solution in Linux/Unix environment. I utilitze inheritance and polymorphism,
        devloped a GUI for a software programming project, implement exception-handling, and was able

        This project was a text based game implemented via the command line, allowing for all different player matchups
        including human vs. computer, human vs. human,and computer vs. computer with different levels of computer
        intelligence. I utilize inheritance and polymorphism, exception handling, and a small implementation of
        simple artificial intelligence.

     <h3><strong><a href="https://github.com/harlibott/Lists"target="_blank" rel="noopener">LISTS</h3></strong></a>
      <p>
        In this project, I provided two different implementations of
        a generic List interface, which defines different operations that one
        should be able to do with a list. The list implementation decides how the
        elements are stored internally so long as users are able to interact with
        those elements via the methods defined in the interface. In this way, a list
        is an example of an abstract data type*(ADT). Implementation of the list methods included
        sorting, adding, removing, clearing, getting, setting, and more.

<!-- intro paragraph text-->
<p id="introparagraph">
  I am a full-time, 3rd-year student at The University of Georgia. For the first one and a half years of college
  I jumped around from two different science majors: Biology and Excercise Science. But those two majors never
  clicked for me. But in the Spring of 2017, <strong>I began to pursue a B.S. in Computer Science and finally
  felt like I found something that I loved.</strong> Since then, I have developed a passion for Software Engineering! <br><br>
  <strong>I am currently searching for Software Engineering internships</strong> during the Summer of '18  to gain more
  knowledge in programming! I am also a part of UGA's Association of Computing Machinery chapter.
  Here, I get to connect with other computer programmers and attend socials where big companies will come
  to speak with us about many opportunities.</br></br> Aside from programming and school work, I lead worship
  at a church called First Baptist Church of Woodstock, enjoy playing piano and guitar, and riding horses.
